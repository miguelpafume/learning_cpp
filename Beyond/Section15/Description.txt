An Account has a name and a balance.

A Savings Account is an Account and adds an interest rate.

Your challenge is the following:

2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
    A Trust account has a name, a balance, and an interest rate
    The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.
    However, any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.
    
    The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20% of the account balance.
    You don't have to keep track of calendar time for this application, just make sure the 4th withdrawal fails

If you want more practice with operator overloading you can overload += and -= for deposit and withdrawal
